This repository contains all the components of the data science module for ASU's EEE 350: Random Signal Analysis.

## Primary Objective

The primary objective for this module is to reinforce the statistical concepts introduced in class through the process of building a data analysis pipeline. Statistical concepts are first implemented to gain an understanding of the data, and this understanding is then used to implement machine learning models. The module is split into two assignments: the first part has students work with the dataset to gain insight into its variables and underlying relationships (exploratory data analysis), and the second part has students implement supervised machine learning models to generate predictions that may inform the decision making of airlines. The machine learning assignment provides additional introductions to the underlying concepts and focuses on interpreting the results rather than coding the models by providing function wrappers to expedite the process.

## Student Expectations

This module was designed for the cohort of students enrolled in Dr. Wangâ€™s class, therefore assuming some working knowledge of MATLAB coding. The module also assumes students have covered some basic probability (e.g., normal distributions) and statistical (e.g., hypothesis testing) concepts in their class.

## Learning Objectives
By completing the module, you will:
1. Understand the steps of exploratory data analysis and what conclusions can be drawn about the relationships in the data.
2. Understand the difference between regression and classification and the conclusions that can be drawn from each.
3. Create and interpret data visualizations to evaluate models and answer questions.
4. Gain comfort applying the aforementioned concepts to a real-world dataset and interpreting and presenting the results in an informative manner.
